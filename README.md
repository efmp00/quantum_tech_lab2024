## Quantum Technology 2024
Repository where I upload my work in the Quantum Technology course at KTH Royal Institute of Technology. The topics covered are the following:
- [x] Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors.
- [x] Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices.
- [x] Quantized Conductance.
- [x] Optical continuous variable squeezed light.
- [x] Quantum Erasure.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code uploaded in this repository is mainly written in Python 3.10.12.

> [!NOTE]
> Since this is an active course at KTH, I will only upload the code and lab report I handed in for one of the five lab modules and only the experimental data for the remaining modules.
